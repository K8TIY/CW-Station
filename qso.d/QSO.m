/*
 * Generate QSO
 */

/*
 * When run, this program generates a single QSO. The form of the
 * QSO is similar to QSO's one would expect to hear at a code test.
 * It begins with a series of V's (commented out in this version),
 * callsigns of the receiver and
 * sender, followed by a few sentences about weather, name,
 * occupation, etc. The QSO ends with the callsigns of the receiver
 * and sender.
 *
 * All output is produced using "printf." This should make the
 * program easy to port. Output can be piped into another program
 * such as sparc-morse on the Sun or it can be redirected into
 * a file (without viewing the contents of course!)
 *
 * The program design is similar to a "random poetry generator"
 * or "mad-libs." Each QSO form is generated by its own C function,
 * such as "PutForm1." Each function calls other C functions to
 * produce the sentences in the QSO. The sentence forms are
 * selected somewhat randomly as well as any blanks to be filled.
 * Words and phrases are selected from several lists such as
 * "Transceiver," "Antenna," "Job," etc. Sometimes this scheme is
 * clever as in the formation of city names. Sometimes it is
 * stupidly simple-minded and grammatical agreement is lost.
 * By the way, the callsigns are real and were picked from
 * rec.radio.amateur.misc on USENET.
 *
 * The program was constructed in C for Sun workstations. It uses
 * the library function "drand48" in function "Roll" to produce
 * pseudo-random numbers. The library function "srand48" and "time"
 * in "main" are used to set the pseudo-random number seed.
 *
 * Known problems and caveats? Hey, it`s software! All Morse
 * training programs handle the procedural signs (e.g., AR, SK)
 * differently. The function "PutQSO" currently prints "+ %"
 * for the AR and SK at the end of the QSO. These may be ignored,
 * mapped into something else, or just plain cause your training
 * program to roll over and play dead. I don`t know. This is a
 * cheap hack.
 *
 * And speaking of cheap... The program will not generate all
 * characters and pro-signs that are found on an "official" code
 * test. This program is for practice only and should be supplemented
 * with lots of random code.
 *
 * Always have fun!
